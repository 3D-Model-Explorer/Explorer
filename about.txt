  <p>
    👋 Hi there! This awesome page was created by <strong>Mohammed Yousef</strong> to show how cool 3D modeling can be! 🧊🚀
  </p>
  <p>
    🖼️ Some of the 3D models come from Sketchfab and are used under special licenses — kind of like borrowing cool toys to show your friends!
  </p>
  <p>
    🧠 What is 3D modeling? It's like making shapes on the computer that look real! You can spin them, zoom in, and look at them from every side.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's a fun way to build cars, spaceships, characters, and anything you can dream of — all using digital clay! 🪐🎨💻
